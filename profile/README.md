# Home task subbmission

As for the submission of the task, we fully understand that people have lives outside of work. Therefore, we do not expect home tasks to be subbmited in a day or two. On average, we get them back in a week. But if more time is needed - simply inform your recruiter, so everyone is updated.

Once you have finished the task, please inform your recruiter. He/She will then assign a developer straight away to start the review process (typically takes 1-2 days) and share full feedback with you.

We wish you all the best and will look forward to meeting you for a technical discussion! Good luck!
